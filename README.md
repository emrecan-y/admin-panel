# Admin Panel

This is a frontend for an Admin Panel designed and built by me using **Vanilla JavaScript** and **Tailwind CSS**. It connects to a simple backend provided for this task.

## Task Overview

The task began with creating a design using a tool of my choice. I chose **Figma** to design the layout for both **desktop** and **mobile** versions of the Admin Panel.

## Conclusion

After finalizing the design, I focused on implementing it as closely as possible. Although I couldn't complete the project due to other tasks, I learned a lot along the way:

- **Vanilla JavaScript**: This project gave me the opportunity to work with Vanilla JS and handle the DOM directly without a framework.
- **Tailwind CSS**: My first experience with Tailwind CSS, learning how to quickly build layouts.
- **Responsive Design**: Built a responsive interface using Tailwind.
